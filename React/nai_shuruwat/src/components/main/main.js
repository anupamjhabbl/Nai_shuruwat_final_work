                <h2>How did this start?</h2>
            <p>Up to 811 million people are going hungry, more than 2 billion suffer from malnutrition, but there is enough food, knowledge and resources for all. And what's more, food is a human right.So we decided to take a small initiative to solve the problem of hunger and bring people  together who want to help and who need help.we started this community on 23 january,2020 in Patna,Bihar and then eventually spreads its operation to the other cities New Delhi,Mumbai,Kolkata,Hyderabad,
            Pune,Dehradun,Chennai,Bengaluru
            ,Bhopal,Jaipur.Also we are actively working in many Forign countries like <b>Siera leone,Haiti,Libera,Madagascar,
            Congo,Yemen,Somalia etc.</b>But we feels that we have done just 1% of our aim.We can complete our aim only with more and more people so we requeest everyone to come forward to help.  </p>
